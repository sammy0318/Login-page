 HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages.

 CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML, etc.). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media types.
